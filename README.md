# Radann

Radann stands for **Reverse-mode Automatic Differentiation for Artificial Neural Networks**
and is *(hopefully going to be, some day)* a modern C++17 library for multidimentional array handling and automatic differentiation,
implemented using smart expression templates with GPU parallelism and calls to optimized CUDA libraries.

As for now, it is a university coursework with a lot of unfinished and "just working" stuff that is subject to change.
